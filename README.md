# 🛰️ Autonomous Mars Rover Simulation  
**Real-Time LiDAR Mapping and Terrain Analysis on Martian Surface (Jezero Crater)**  
*Developed using MATLAB and Simulink*

## 🚀 Overview  
This project simulates an autonomous Mars Rover performing real-time mapping and terrain analysis using LiDAR, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), and Grid Mapping techniques. The simulation focuses on environmental perception, surface profiling, and obstacle-aware navigation—using real data from Jezero Crater, Mars.

## 📌 Objectives  
- Simulate LiDAR sensor scanning for terrain mapping  
- Process Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of the Martian surface  
- Generate point clouds and height maps  
- Create grid maps for obstacle detection and safe navigation  
- Visualize rover surroundings and topographical variations in 3D

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **MATLAB** – Matrix operations, 3D plotting, data visualization  
- **Simulink** – System modeling and LiDAR scanning  
- **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)** – From Jezero Crater (NASA dataset)  
- **LiDAR Simulation** – 360° synthetic scans  
- **Point Cloud Generation**  
- **Occupancy Grid Mapping**
